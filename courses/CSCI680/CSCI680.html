<h2 id="toc_2">Overview</h2>

<p>Deep Transfer Learning is an advanced graduate-level course that explores the intersection of deep learning and transfer learning techniques in the field of machine learning. Specifically, this course focuses on the two major advances in the field of deep transfer learning in recent years: unsupervised domain adaptation and domain generalization. This course equips students with the knowledge and practical skills necessary to develop deep learning algorithms generalizable to new data. It delves into the practical methodologies and cutting-edge research developments in the domain of deep transfer learning.</p>

<h2 id="toc_12">Final Project</h2>

<p>20% of your total mark is allocated to a final project, which will require you to apply several algorithms to a challenge problem and to write a short report analyzing the results. You are allowed to collaborate with at most 2 classmates on the final project. In other words, the maximal number of people a group can have is 3. </p>
