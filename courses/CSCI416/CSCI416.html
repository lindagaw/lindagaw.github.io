<h1>CSCI 416/516 Fall 2023: Introduction to Machine Learning</h1>

<h2 id="toc_2">Overview</h2>

<p>Machine learning (ML) is a set of techniques that allow computers to learn from data and experience, rather than requiring humans to specify the desired behaviour by hand. ML has become increasingly central both in AI as an academic field, and in industry. This course provides a broad introduction to some of the most commonly used ML algorithms. It also serves to introduce key algorithmic principles which will serve as a foundation for more advanced courses, such as Deep Learning.</p>

<h2 id="toc_5">Homeworks</h2>

<p>This class will have three homeworks, each of which due exactly 2 weeks after being posted. Please come back to this page once it is annouced during the class that a homework is posted. The homeworks are collected using Blackboard.</p>
<p>Homeworks will be accepted up to 4 days late, but 10% will be deducted for each day late, rounded up to the nearest day. No credit will be given for assignments submitted after 4 days. Extensions will be granted only in special situations with valid proof (e.g. Doctor’s note).</p>
<p>In each homework, there will be additional 1-2 question(s) required for graduate students but optional to undergraduate students. If an undergraduate student answers correctly to such questions, they will receive extra credits, in addition to the (at maximum) 15 pts they could obtain on a homework.</p>

<p>After the 3rd/last homework is due, you should focus on the final, deliverable project. </p>

<h2 id="toc_12">Final Project</h2>

<p>20% of your total mark is allocated to a final project, which will require you to apply several algorithms to a challenge problem and to write a short report analyzing the results. You are allowed to collaborate with at most 2 classmates on the final project. In other words, the maximal number of people a group can have is 3. </p>

<p><a href="./Projects/CSCI_416_516_Final_Project.pdf">Instructions</a> on the final project is avaiable. </p>
