<h1>CSCI 416/516 Fall 2023: Introduction to Machine Learning</h1>

<h2 id="toc_2">Overview</h2>

<p>Machine learning (ML) is a set of techniques that allow computers to learn from data and experience, rather than requiring humans to specify the desired behaviour by hand. ML has become increasingly central both in AI as an academic field, and in industry. This course provides a broad introduction to some of the most commonly used ML algorithms. It also serves to introduce key algorithmic principles which will serve as a foundation for more advanced courses, such as Deep Learning.</p>

<h2 id="toc_5">Homeworks</h2>

<p>This class will have three homeworks, each of which due exactly 2 weeks after being posted. Please come back to this page once it is annouced during the class that a homework is posted. The homeworks are collected during the lectures on the due dates.</p>
<p>After the 3rd/last homework is due, you should focus on the final, deliverable project. </p>

<h2 id="toc_12">Final Project</h2>

<p>20% of your total mark is allocated to a final project, which will require you to apply several algorithms to a challenge problem and to write a short report analyzing the results. The deadline for final project is December 8th (last day of classes). </p>
