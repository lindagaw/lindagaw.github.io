						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p> Slightly above 5 feet and I am very conscious of my height. 
							My childhood dream was to embark on a journey with my definitely-real-not-imaginary pal Bulbasaur and investigate the world of Pokemon, which
							I half-realized when I made one of my term papers in college on Pokemon (and got an A). My normal outfits are a wide range of
							costumes that can pass as usual clothes, in most occassion. 
						</p>

						<h2>Educational History</h2>
						<p>At the ripe age of 22 I graduated with a B.S., to my parents' great pleasure, and with a B.A., 
							to my parents' great displeasure. My parents really tried to shape me into a hardcore scientist without
							 any interests in humanities and social sciences, so I did my B.A. in secret to protest. 
						</p>

						<h2>Employment</h2>
						<p>At the age of 18 I sold my soul to the root of all evil, signing a contract with a literature organization / authors' guild
							whose idealogoies on what consistutes art and literature ... were not in agreement with mine. Fortunately, 
						my contract will end soon and I no longer have to abide by their rules. </p>

						<h2>Hobbies</h2>

						<p>I fancy myself a digital artist, albeit a bad one. I do have an art blog to which I upload my fair 
							share of contribution to various fandoms. If you are interested,
							here is the <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/blog/gradient-descent"> link </a> to my blog. 
							I'm NOT to be held responsible if my paitnings unnerve you. 
						</p>

						<p>I am a poet, but I detest iambic pentameter. I'm not yet comfortable to show the Internet my poems, but here 
							are some titles: <i>The Catacomb</i>, in which a strange analogy of the concept of binary search tree and the Hippocratic oath
							is made, <i>Martyrdom</i>, in which a crazed man yearns for Duessa, the 
							temptress demonized to glorify Elizabeth I and her Protestantism.  
						</p>

						<p>I am also a video game enthusiast, (possibily) to the chargin of my undergrad honors thesis advisor, dearest friend,
							and distinguished professor in classical literature. Despite my effort, she remains unconvinced that video 
							games are the simulation of modern mythology, but at least she approves that many video games are developed to
							 promote diversity and justice, in one way or another. 
						</p>
